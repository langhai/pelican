<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Often times people ask me whether or not a guy/girl comes from China. I was
quite annoyed by such questions back then since I thought it's obvious to tell
the difference between what I call <em>'China Chinese'</em> and <em>'Local Chinese'</em>.</p>
<p>I realized that I was wrong when I failed to differentiate <em>'India Indians'</em> and
<em>'Local Indians'</em>, and my friend Kumar can judge even by the way how they
walk. I started to get the hang of it after he explained me some tricks, and
then I thought, hey, maybe I can do everyone a favor and share some basic tips
on how to do the same trick on my beloved Chinese fellows ;-)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="about-this-guide">
<h2>About This Guide</h2>
<p>If you are about to go after some Chinese guy/girl or just want to expand your
social circle to have more Chinese friends, and you are troubled by the
difference between <em>'China Chinese'</em> and <em>'Local Chinese</em>', but you have none or
minimal knowledge of any kind of Chinese culture, and you don't speak Mandarin,
Cantonese, or Hokkien, then no worries, this guide is for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technical-stuff-you-can-skip-this-safely">
<h2>Technical Stuff (You can skip this safely)</h2>
<p>For starters, most local Chinese originated from southern part of China,
namely Guangdong and Fujian province. The dialects they speak are Cantonese and
Hokkien accordingly.</p>
<img alt="Map of China" class="align-center" src="../../../../static/images/china_map.gif" style="width: 640.0px; height: 420.0px;" />
<p>As shown in the map above, including Hainan island, the last three rows on the map
are normally considered as the <em>'Southern China'</em>. All Chinese folks share the same
written language, but the difference between dialects, esp. southern vs northern are
often overwhelming even to a native Chinese speaker.</p>
<p>We share roughly the same culture, with slight differences between provinces. Knowing
some of the differences can even help to tell which province a person comes from. It
becomes rather obvious when it comes to southern vs. northern.
For instance, people are still arguing whether <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zongzi">Zongzi</a> should be salty or sweetened
throughout different parts of China. (I'm team sweet by the way.)</p>
<p>As what I said, most <em>'Local Chinese'</em>'s forefathers were born and rised in Guangdong,
Fujian, and in some cases Hainan, hijacked by our beloved British, and travelled all
the way to Malaysia / Indonesia / America and so on. Although generations of living in
another country has developped them some strange (no offence) habbits, they still carry
some rather distinct and obvious culture heritages from their home provinces.</p>
<p>On the other hand, most <em>'China Chinese'</em> you meet nowadays are highly unlikely from
Guangdong or Fujian (Look at the sizes of all other provinces and imagine the population
there). And even if they do come from the said provinces, Mandarin is now the official
language we speak throughout China, and that greatly affects our English accents (I'll
talk about it later).
And this is the foundation of our theory, knowing the differences between these
two provinces and all others would be sufficient to master the art of differentiating
Chinese folks.</p>
