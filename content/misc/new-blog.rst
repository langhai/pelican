I've been looking for a better blogging platform for quite a while. `Toto`_ is a great project but there are just
too many things to customize, and I really miss tagging and categories ;-p

So I changed to `Pelican`_. It's customizable, fast, it generates static HTML pages. And yea, it supports tags and
categories (YEEEEA!)

I actually lost some of my posts when I was migrating my old wordpress blog to Toto, so in order to prevent
this from happening again. I'm just gonna create a new subdomain for the Toto site, and slowly migrate those
posts to this new site (yea I'm a lazy ass).

Just in case if anyone wants to see my older posts (The FreeBSD Rootkit Design series) 
while I'm migrating, just use `this link`_.
