Hello there, my name is Hai Lang.

I'm from China currently living in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
I finished my computer science degree with specialization in computer system security 
from `Asia Pacific University`_, and I'm now working as a system anylyst at
the `Research and Development Department`_ of my college. We are  currently developing
an education ERP system.

I like music, play a little bit instruments, like watching movies and playing games, 
I do enjoy writing novels as well.

I'm a freelancer, I accept server maintenance and development jobs.
My clients are mostly from China, including `Kongjie.Com`_, `Shufa.Org`_, 
and some other small to medium size companies.

You can find me on `Facebook`_, `Twitter`_, `LinkedIn`_, and `Sina WeiBo`_, 
but I'm not a big fan of any social network to be honest.
