.. highlights::
    Third question from Project Euler, finding the largest factor of a prime number.

Great, I've actually been researching in prime numebrs recently.
Got this crazy idea, or a hypotheses few month ago,
but never had the time to prove it.
I spent days trying to figure out better way to generate prime numbers, since my
crazy theory involves large primes, I mean, really large ones...
Anyway, turns out it's indeed just a crazy thought, not worth mentioning.

Get back to the topic. `Problem 3`_ asks to find the lagest prime factors of the number
600851475143. Not a large number to be frank. So I'll stick simplest factorization 
algorithm for this particular question.

I guess I'll write a review on more complex factorization algorithms, those that are used
to factor large prime numbers in number theory and cryptograhy. Will get back and put 
the link here if you are interested to know more.

.. code-block:: python

    def prime_factorization(n):
        factors = []
        x = 2
        while x <= n:
            if n % x == 0:
                n /= x
                factors.append(x)
            else:
                x += 1
        return factors

This is like a brute-force algorithm, put x in the factors list if n is divisible by x,
then divide n by x before next iteration. If n cannot be divided by x, then increase the 
value of x by 1.

Then I can just do this to get the result

.. code-block:: python

    print "The answer is: " + str(max(prime_factorization(600851475143)))

And the answer is **6857**.

Few things to keep in mind

1. Except prime numbers, **all** whole numbers can be broken down into prime factors

2. There's no need to check whether x is a prime number, it is guaranteed to be prime

To explain this, take a look at the example below.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> prime_factorization(100)
    [2, 2, 5, 5]

Of course, 100 can be factored into non-prime numbers like 4, 10, 20, 25, 50. But as
I have explained in (1), all these non-prime numbers can be divided into prime number factors.

4 = 2 * 2  

10 = 2 * 5

20 = 2 * 2 * 5

And so on. The fact that the program starts with smallest prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7...) prevents
non-prime factors.

Lastly, note that it's x **<=** n
